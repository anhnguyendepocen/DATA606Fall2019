Welcome to DATA606! My name is Dr. Jason Bryer and I will be your instructor for this semester. In addition to teaching this course, I am an Executive Director at Excelsior College where I am currently working on a Department of Education grant to develop a Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (see [www.DAACS.net](https://www.DAACS.net) for more information). Couple of important notes as you get started:

* The course syllabus is on Github here: https://data606.net I will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for submitting assignments.
* [Join the Slack channel by clicking here](https://join.slack.com/t/data606fall2019/shared_invite/enQtNzE2NTc5NTMwMjExLTI5MGU3ZTNmZjcyZTNkNDhiOTZiNjY3YmI0N2NjOGNhZDM2ZWUxZTE0ZTdiNTNlN2JkMmFlMmQyNTdjYTEyYzY). This will be our primary mode of communication. For private communications, you can either send private Slack messages or email me at [jason.bryer@gmail.com](mailto:jason.bryer@gmail.com).
* Introduce yourself in the Getting Acquainted forum on Blackboard.
* Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 1 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudio and will help get you get acquainted with R.
* The best way to reach me is by Slack or email at [jason.bryer@gmail.com](mailto:jason.bryer@gmail.com). If you would prefer to talk on the phone or setup a GoToMeeting session, it is best to suggest some times by email first.
* Our meetups will be on Wednesdays from 8:30pm to 9:30pm.
* I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and a fantastic semester! Good luck!
