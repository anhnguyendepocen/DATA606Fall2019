<p>Welcome to DATA606! My name is Dr.Â Jason Bryer and I will be your instructor for this semester. In addition to teaching this course, I am an Executive Director at Excelsior College where I am currently working on a Department of Education grant to develop a Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (see <a href="https://www.DAACS.net">www.DAACS.net</a> for more information). Couple of important notes as you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course syllabus is on Github here: <a href="https://data606.net" class="uri">https://data606.net</a> I will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for submitting assignments.</li>
<li><a href="https://join.slack.com/t/data606fall2019/shared_invite/enQtNzE2NTc5NTMwMjExLTI5MGU3ZTNmZjcyZTNkNDhiOTZiNjY3YmI0N2NjOGNhZDM2ZWUxZTE0ZTdiNTNlN2JkMmFlMmQyNTdjYTEyYzY">Join the Slack channel by clicking here</a>. This will be our primary mode of communication. For private communications, you can either send private Slack messages or email me at <a href="mailto:jason.bryer@gmail.com">jason.bryer@gmail.com</a>.</li>
<li>Introduce yourself in the Getting Acquainted forum on Blackboard.</li>
<li>Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 1 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudio and will help get you get acquainted with R.</li>
<li>The best way to reach me is by Slack or email at <a href="mailto:jason.bryer@gmail.com">jason.bryer@gmail.com</a>. If you would prefer to talk on the phone or setup a GoToMeeting session, it is best to suggest some times by email first.</li>
<li>Our meetups will be on Wednesdays from 8pm to 9pm.</li>
<li>I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and a fantastic semester! Good luck!</li>
