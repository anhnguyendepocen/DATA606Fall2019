## Chapter 4

## Assignments

### Homework

*OpenIntro Statistics*

* Practice: 4.1 (see `normalPlot`), 4.3, 4.17 (use `qqnormsim` from lab 4), 4.21, 4.37, 4.41
* Graded: 4.2 (see `normalPlot`), 4.4, 4.18 (use `qqnormsim` from lab 4), 4.22, 4.38, 4.42

### Lab

The labs are available in the `DATA606` R package. To start the first lab, use the `startLab` function. This will copy the lab to your current working directory and rename the file according to your computer username (as returend by `Sys.info()['user']`). If this is incorrect, then either provide the `file-prefix` parameter to `startLab`, or rename the file after it has been copied.


```r
DATA606::startLab('Lab4')
```
