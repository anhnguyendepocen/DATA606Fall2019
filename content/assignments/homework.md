The solutions to the practice problems are at the end of the book and do not need to be handed in. Graded assignments should be typed (preferably using R Markdown) or neatly hand written and scanned. Data for the homework assignments, and for within the chapters too, can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2019/tree/master/data/os3_data). Or alternatively all the data is included in the `openintro` R packge (use the `data(package = 'openintro')` command to list all the datasets available in that package).

* Chapter 1 - Introduction to Data
	* Practice: 1.7 (available in R using the `data(iris)` command), 1.9, 1.23, 1.33, 1.55, 1.69
to load the data)
* Chapter 2 - Summarizing Data
	* Practice
* Chapter 3 - Probability
	* Practice: 3.5, 3.7, 3.19, 3.29, 3.43
* Chapter 4 - Distributions of Random Variables
	* Practice: 4.1 (see `normalPlot`), 4.3, 4.17 (use `qqnormsim` from lab 4), 4.21, 4.37, 4.41
* Chapter 5 - Foundations for Inference
	* Practice: 5.3, 5.13, 5.23, 5.25, 5.39, 5.47
* Chapter 6 - Inference for Categorical Data
	* Practice: 6.5, 6.13, 6.19, 6.31, 6.45
* Chapter 7 - Inference for Numerical Data
	* Practice: 7.5, 7.11, 7.27, 7.43, 7.47
* Chapter 8 - Introduction to Linear Regression
	* Practice: 8.23, 8.25, 8.29, 8.39
