	"content": " Chapter 1 - Introduction to Data Learning Objectives  Identify the type of variables (e.g. numerical or categorical; discrete or continuous; ordered or not ordered). Identify the relationship between multiple variables (i.e. independent vs. dependent). Define variables that are not associated as independent. Be able to describe and identify the difference between observational and experimental studies. Distinguish between simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling, and recognize the benefits and drawbacks of choosing one sampling scheme over another. Identify the four principles of experimental design and recognize their purposes: control any possible con- founders, randomize into treatment and control groups, replicate by using a sufficiently large sample or repeating the experiment, and block any variables that might influence the response.  Readings  OpenIntro Statistics slides  Videos OpenIntro provides a number of videos. You may find these helpful while reading the chapter.\nCase Study: Using Stents to Prevent Strokes\n Data Basics: Observations, Variable, and Data Matrices\n Data Collection Principles\n Observational Studies and Sampling Strategies\n Designing Experiments\n Using Randomization to Analyze a Gender Discrimination Study\n "

This is probably a difficult to answer.\nHowever, consider the bar plot below. Here, we cleary see there is a difference between the ratio of the three colors.

	"content": " Chapter 3 Learning Outcomes  Define trial, outcome, and sample space. Define and describe the law of large numbers. Distinguish disjoint (also called mutually exclusive) and independent events. Use Venn diagrams to represent events and their probabilities. Describe probability distributions. Distinguish between marginal and conditional probabilities. Use tree diagrams and/or Bayes Theorem to calculate conditional probabilities and probabilities of intersection of non-independent events. The expected value of a discrete random variable is computed by adding each outcome weighted by its probability.\n$$ E(X)=\\mu =\\sum { i=1 }^{ k }{ { x }{ i }P\\left( X={ x }_{ i } \\right) } $$ The variance of a discrete random variable is computed by adding each squared deviation of an outcome from the expected value weighted by its probability. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n$$ Var(X)={ \\sigma }^{ 2 }=\\sum { i=1 }^{ k }{ { \\left( { x }{ i }-\\mu \\right) }P\\left( X={ x }_{ i } \\right) } $$ The average of a linear combination of discrete random variables is computed as the sum of their averages, weighted by the constant multipliers. The variance of a linear combination of independent discrete random variables is computed as the sum of their variances, weighted by the square of the constant multipliers. The distribution of a continuous random variable is described by the probability density function. The total area under the density curve is 1. Probabilities under the density curve can be calculated as the area under the curve. The probability of a continuous random variable being exactly equal to a value is 0, since there is no area under the curve at a given location.  Readings  OpenIntro Statistics slides\n Matloff, N.

Documents are written in plain text files. Formatting the document is done using specific markup. If you have used HTML, the framework is similar however instead of using \u0026lt;TAG\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/TAG\u0026gt; syntax, LaTeX uses \\TAG{} format. We will primarily use Markdown, and its extension R Markdown for preparing documents in this class. However, when preparing PDF documents, the Markdown will first be converted to LaTeX before creating the PDF file. As such, a LaTeX converter is necessary. There are LaTeX installers for Windows (MiKTeX) and Mac (BasicTeX). Alternatively, the tinytex R package provides an easier way of installing LaTeX directly from within R:\ninstall.packages('tinytex') tinytex::install_tinytex()  Source Control All course materials will be made available on Github which provides an implementation of the git open source version control system. RStudio supports git directly, but I recommend downloading Sourcetree. This is a free desktop client that provides an easier interface for working with Github.

There are two components to the project, the proposal, which will be graded on a pass/fail basis, and the final report. The outline for each of these are provided in the templates. When submitting the assignments, include the R Markdown file (change the name to include your last name, for example Bryer-Proposal.Rmd and Bryer-Project.Rmd) along with any supplementary files necessary to run the R Markdown file (e.g. data files, screenshots, etc.). Suggestions for possible data sources are included below, however you are free to use data not listed below. The only requirement is that you are allowed to share the data. Projects will be shared with others on this website so should be presented in a way that other students can reproduce your analysis.\nProject Proposal The proposal can be more informal using bullet points where necessary and include R code and output. You must address the following areas:\n Research question What are the cases, and how many are there? Describe the method of data collection. What type of study is this (observational/experiment)? Data Source: If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link. Response: What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)? Explanatory: What is the explanatory variable(s), and what type is it (numerical/categorival)? Relevant summary statistics  Example data project proposal (Source Rmarkdown file)\nFinal Project Format The final report should be presented in more formal format. Consider your audience to be non data analysts. Fellow data analysts (i.e. students) will be able to access your R Markdown file for details on the analysis. Submit a Zip file with your R Markdown file, the HTML output, and any supplementary files (e.g. data, figures, etc.). You must address the five following sections:\n Introduction: What is your research question? Why do you care? Why should others care?\n Data: Write about the data from your proposal in text form. Address the following points:\n Data collection: Describe how the data were collected. Cases: What are the cases? (Remember: case = units of observation or units of experiment) Variables: What are the two variables you will be studying? State the type of each variable. Type of study: What is the type of study, observational or an experiment? Explain how you\u0026rsquo;ve arrived at your conclusion using information on the sampling and/or experimental design. Scope of inference - generalizability: Identify the population of interest, and whether the findings from this analysis can be generalized to that population, or, if not, a subsection of that population. Explain why or why not. Also discuss any potential sources of bias that might prevent generalizability. Scope of inference - causality: Can these data be used to establish causal links between the variables of interest? Explain why or why not.  Exploratory data analysis: Perform relevant descriptive statistics, including summary statistics and visualization of the data. Also address what the exploratory data analysis suggests about your research question.\n Inference: If your data fails some conditions and you can\u0026rsquo;t use a theoretical method, then you should use simulation. If you can use both methods, then you should use both methods. It is your responsibility to figure out the appropriate methodology.\n Check conditions Theoretical inference (if possible) - hypothesis test and confidence interval Simulation based inference - hypothesis test and confidence interval Brief description of methodology that reflects your conceptual understanding\n  Conclusion: Write a brief summary of your findings without repeating your statements from earlier. Also include a discussion of what you have learned about your research question and the data you collected. You may also want to include ideas for possible future research.\n  Data Sources You are not to use data sources used in class or the textbooks. Possible data sources include, but are not limited to:\n FiveThirtyEight https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data RStudio data sources http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/07/23/new-data-packages/ Analyze Survey Data for Free (ASDFree) has many open data sources that can be used http://www.asdfree.com/ The World Bank Data Catalog http://datacatalog.worldbank.org/ Google Public Data search engine http://www.google.com/publicdata/directory Vanderbilt data sources http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets Programme of International Student Assessment (PISA) http://www.oecd.org/pisa/ Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/ World Values Survey http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp American National Election Survey (ANES) http://www.electionstudies.org/ General Social Survey (GSS) http://www3.norc.org/GSS+Website/ Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/ U.S. Census and American Community Survey https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/acs/index.html  "

With the editor, you can enter quations using menus.\nOnce done, copy and paste the LaTeX code at teh bottom into your R Markdown file between two dollar signs (i.e. $), and the quation will be rendered by the web browser.\n$$ f\\left( x|\\mu ,\\sigma \\right) =\\frac { 1 }{ \\sigma \\sqrt { 2\\pi } } { e }^{ -\\frac { { \\left( x-\\mu \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ { 2\\sigma }^{ 2 } } } $$\n"

	"content": "  Chapter 1 Chapter 1 - Introduction to Data Learning Objectives Identify the type of variables (e.g. numerical or categorical; discrete or continuous; ordered or not ordered). Identify the relationship between multiple variables (i.e. independent vs. dependent). Define variables that are not associated as independent. Be able to describe and identify the difference between observational and experimental studies. Distinguish between simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling, and recognize the benefits and drawbacks of choosing one sampling scheme over another.\n  Chapter 2 Chapter 2 Learning Outcomes Use appropriate visualizations for different types of data (e.g. histogram, barplot, scatterplot, boxplot, etc.). Use different measures of center and spread and be able to describe the robustness of different statistics. Describe the shape of distributions vis-à-vis histograms and boxplots. Create and intepret contingency and frequency tables (one- and two-way tables). Readings OpenIntro Statistics slides ggplot2 - ggplot2 is an R package by Wickham that implements the grammer of graphics (Wilkinson, 2005) in R.\n  Chapter 3 Chapter 3 Learning Outcomes Define trial, outcome, and sample space. Define and describe the law of large numbers. Distinguish disjoint (also called mutually exclusive) and independent events. Use Venn diagrams to represent events and their probabilities. Describe probability distributions. Distinguish between marginal and conditional probabilities. Use tree diagrams and/or Bayes Theorem to calculate conditional probabilities and probabilities of intersection of non-independent events. The expected value of a discrete random variable is computed by adding each outcome weighted by its probability.\n  Chapter 4  Chapter 4 Readings OpenIntro Statistics slides Videos   Chapter 5  Chapter 5 Readings OpenIntro Statistics slides Videos   Chapter 6  Chapter 6 Readings OpenIntro Statistics slides Videos   Chapter 7  Chapter 7 Readings OpenIntro Statistics slides Videos   Chapter 8  Chapter 8 Readings OpenIntro Statistics slides Linear regression with SAT scores - This document outlines the implementation of linear regression step-by-step emphasizing visualizations.

	"content": " DATA606 - Fall 2019 Instructor: Jason Bryer, Ph.D.\nClass Meetup: Wednesday 8:00pm to 9:00pm\nOffice Hours: By appointment\nEmail: jason.bryer@gmail.com\nCourse Description This course covers basic techniques in probability and statistics that are important in the field of data analytics. Discrete probability models, sampling from infinite and finite populations, statistical distributions, basic Bayesian statistics, and non-parametric statistical techniques for categorical data are covered in this course. Each of these statistical concepts will be applied in a variety of real-world scenarios through the use of case studies and customized data sets.\nCourse Learning Outcomes: By then end of the course, students should be able to:\n Understand the foundations of probability theory and perform basic probability calculations. Build basic stochastic models for commonly encountered business problems. Model situations involving uncertainty using appropriate probability distributions and conditional techniques. Explore and summarize data using descriptive statistics. Test hypotheses using classical and modern computational techniques. Construct estimators and calculate intervals using classical and modern computational techniques. Perform basic Bayesian statistical techniques for estimation and testing hypotheses.  Program Learning Outcomes addressed by the course:  Business Understanding. Learn when probabilistic techniques apply to certain categories of business problems, discuss the sorts of solutions that are possible, and understand the limitations of these techniques. Foundational Math Skills. Explore and analyze data, build probabilistic and statistical models, construct estimators, and test hypotheses. Predictive Modeling. Learn foundational techniques that underlie predictive modeling algorithms, such as Naïve Bayes. Presentation. Complete and submit collaborative assignments using techniques from the course.  How is this course relevant for data analytics professionals? Probabilistic techniques are the foundation of many data science applications from data exploration and visualization to outlier analysis, stochastic modelling, and data mining algorithms. This course will ensure that students have a strong understanding of these foundations.\nGrading  Homework (16%) Labs (40%) Data Project (20%) Final exam (18%) Meetup Presentation (5%) Getting Aquainted (1%)  Grade Distribution    Quality of Performance Letter Grade Range % GPA     Excellent - work is of exceptional quality A 93 - 100 4   Excellent A- 90 - 92.9 3.7   Good - work is above average B+ 87 - 89.9 3.3   Satisfactory B 83 - 86.9 3   Below Average B- 80 - 82.9 2.7   Poor C+ 77 - 79.9 2.3   Poor C 70 - 76.9 2   Failure F \u0026lt; 70 0    How This Course Works: This course is conducted entirely online. Each week, you will have various resources made available, including weekly readings from the textbooks and occasionally additional readings provided by the instructor. Most weeks will have homework assignments to be submitted. There will also be a presentation required and a forum post introduction required. You are expected to complete all assignments by their due dates.\nMeetup presentations will comprise the solution and presentation to the class of one of the suggested problems for study from the weekly materials (not the graded homework problems). Each student must present one problem throughout the semester. Problems are chosen by entering your name and problem in the Google Spreadsheet. Note there is a maximum of three presentations per meetup and presentations should be no more than five minutes. Additionally, prepare your presentation so that the slides or document (I suggest using R Markdown) will be shared on the course website. Problems are assigned first come, first served, so any problem not already chosen by another student is available.\nFurther details on each of these assignments will be available in Blackboard and/or this Github repository.\nTextbooks Required Diez, D.M., Barr, C.D., \u0026amp; Çetinkaya-Rundel, M.
