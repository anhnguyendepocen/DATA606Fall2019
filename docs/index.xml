      <description>Chapter 1 - Introduction to Data Learning Objectives  Identify the type of variables (e.g. numerical or categorical; discrete or continuous; ordered or not ordered). Identify the relationship between multiple variables (i.e. independent vs. dependent). Define variables that are not associated as independent. Be able to describe and identify the difference between observational and experimental studies. Distinguish between simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling, and recognize the benefits and drawbacks of choosing one sampling scheme over another.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2 Learning Outcomes  Use appropriate visualizations for different types of data (e.g. histogram, barplot, scatterplot, boxplot, etc.). Use different measures of center and spread and be able to describe the robustness of different statistics. Describe the shape of distributions vis-à-vis histograms and boxplots. Create and intepret contingency and frequency tables (one- and two-way tables).  Readings  OpenIntro Statistics slides ggplot2 - ggplot2 is an R package by Wickham that implements the grammer of graphics (Wilkinson, 2005) in R.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3 Learning Outcomes  Define trial, outcome, and sample space. Define and describe the law of large numbers. Distinguish disjoint (also called mutually exclusive) and independent events. Use Venn diagrams to represent events and their probabilities. Describe probability distributions. Distinguish between marginal and conditional probabilities. Use tree diagrams and/or Bayes Theorem to calculate conditional probabilities and probabilities of intersection of non-independent events. The expected value of a discrete random variable is computed by adding each outcome weighted by its probability.</description>

      <description>The solutions to the practice problems are at the end of the book and do not need to be handed in. Graded assignments should use the provided R markdown templates provided below. Data for the homework assignments, and for within the chapters too, can be downloaded here. Or alternatively all the data is included in the openintro R packge (use the data(package = &#39;openintro&#39;) command to list all the datasets available in that package).</description>

      <description>These mini projects will have you explore statistical topics using R. You can use the startLab function in the DATA606 package to get started, or copy the templates from the links below. Please submit a PDF (preferred) or HTML file along with your Rmarkdown file. Be sure to answer all questions in lab, not just the on your own section. Labs should be submitted on Blackboard.

      <description>Occasionally you will need to type equations in homework and labs. R Markdown supports LaTeX style equations using the MathJax javascript library. I do not expect you to learn LaTeX for this course. Instead, I recommend using the free application [Daum Equation Editor](). It availabe online, as a Google Chrome Extension, or as a standalone Mac Application.

      <description>Welcome to DATA606! My name is Dr. Jason Bryer and I will be your instructor for this semester. In addition to teaching this course, I am an Executive Director at Excelsior College where I am currently working on a Department of Education grant to develop a Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (see www.DAACS.net for more information). Couple of important notes as you get started:
